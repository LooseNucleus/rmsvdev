WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields exposes ACF Field Groups and Fields to the WPGraphQL Schema.

== Description ==

WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields exposes ACF Field Groups and Fields to the WPGraphQL Schema,
allowing for interacting with ACF field data using GraphQL Queries.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.2 =
* Fixes bug with Nested Fields not properly showing in the Schema. By defualt, fields are not supposed
to be exposed in the Schema if they are not set to "show_in_graphql", however there was a flaw in
logic causing nested fields of Flex Field layouts to not properly be exposed to the Schema. This
fixes that issue, so nested fields of Flex Field layouts can properly be queried and seen in the
Schema.

= 0.1.1 =
* Fixes bug with Field groups not properly being exposed to the Schema for custom post types.

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial public release.


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.1.1 =
ACF Field groups were not properly being added to the GraphQL Schema for Custom Post Types. This
addresses that issue, so now Field groups that are set to "show_in_graphql" and are assigned to a
Custom Post Type that's also set to "show_in_graphql" will now be present in the Schema.
